Using Ubuntu there are guides on youtube on how to create an almost mac like look and feel, including the theme, using also Gnome Tweaks

For some shortcuts, the most difficult seems to be Ctrl-C on terminal to end the command, currently the only option is to make it to Super-X
SHORTCUTS - There is Kinto.sh online that seems to even work to make Windows and Linux to Mac - like, Not tried before
Some shortcuts are edited globally on UI, works pretty well

There is Albert, that has some similiarities to Alfred but i used it sparingly, i found Alt-Space is good for most purpose,
But for the copy or clipboard history, it will definitely be Copy-Q , the workaround on Albert , doesn't paste automatically so it was a two-step on Albert
